Various Delphi components, classes and units.

I used the GDI+ unit from https://www.bilsen.com/gdiplus/index.shtml
I made these components for a project i was working on, but i havent finished this yet. I like to share my components so others can use them if they like to. 

There are various components in here, like a 7 Segment LED label, a Matrix Display that can display text and images, a rotary knob, a toggle switch, a volume progress indicator with falling peaks, a Led indicator and a Volume Trackbar.
I was inspired by FL-Studio for the looks of the components, but most colors can be changed with the object inspector. I will add more components i wrote in the future, for now there is no demo or examples.
